The aim of Collarbear in collaborating with PSP is to collect all payments from Buyers, transfer those payments to eligible Freelancers, and hold funds in respect of the CB Balance. All payment services in connection with fundraising on the Collarbear platform are performed by Collarbear’s PSP.

3. Transaction Tax Fee to PSP equals 11% of the Admin Fee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freelancer may not offer Buyer to make payments using any method other than those provided by Collarbear. If you are asked to use a different payment method, please report it to Collarbear’s Customer Support Service immediately.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You agree to receive bills and/or payment receipts from Collarbear electronically in the form of PDF documents by email, website, or mobile application.

PSP may also collect additional information required to execute payment (balances) withdrawals. Collarbear has no access to payment information submitted to PSP, and this information is subject to PSP's privacy policies. For additional information, please see and read our Privacy Policy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freelancers are completely responsible for paying admin fees, platform fees, direct or indirect taxes, including VAT or income tax, that apply to the User based on where the residency, location or others—are based on the provisions of the applicable jurisdiction in which the Freelancer works. Freelancers represent and warrant that they comply with, and will always comply with, their obligations under the provisions of income tax in the appropriate country where the Freelancer resides. All taxes and fees that may apply to Freelancers are included in the prices stated on the PAW page or the order page.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appointment as Limited Payment Collection Agency: Freelancer hereby appoints Collarbear as its limited authorized payment collection agent solely to obtain payment from Buyer (through PSP, if using its services) and then deliver the payment to Freelancer. Freelancer agrees that payments received from Buyers to Collarbear will be considered the same as payments made directly to Freelancers. Buyer's payment obligations to Seller will be met once payment is received by Collarbear (or PSP, as applicable), and Collarbear is responsible for delivering payments to Freelancer in the manner outlined in these Payment Terms & Conditions. If Collarbear (through PSP) does not pay the requested funds to the Freelancer, the Freelancer will only seek assistance from Collarbear and not the Buyer directly. Collarbear commits to explain or reflect the conditions included in this document in any terms of service, receipt, disclosure, or notification, including (but not limited to) receipts issued to Buyer that Collarbear deems essential or important.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collarbear collaborates with PSP to collect payments from Buyers, deliver those payments to Freelancers, and hold the associated funds in the form of a CB Balance. Collarbear PSP handles all payment processes linked to withdrawing funds from the Collarbear platform.

### **Balance Withdrawal**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both Freelancers and Buyers can withdraw the CB Balance associated with their accounts. As an exception, the PAW Stage Balance tied to a Freelancer's account, cannot be liquidated or transferred for any reason.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Income is available for withdrawal by the Freelancer right away after the order/job status is "Completed". Refunds that are sent to the Buyer's account as CB Balance can likewise be withdrawn instantly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To withdraw your account balance, you must have an account linked to at least one of the PSPs supported by Collarbear for the withdrawal methods indicated in the "Withdrawal Methods" section. Collarbear PSP will provide all payment services, including withdrawal services.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users can only have one bank account registered at a time. Therefore, if the User wishes to modify the saved bank/account number, the existing account will be deleted and replaced with a new account.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All balances in the User's account can be withdrawn, but there is a minimum amount that must be attained before withdrawals can be done.The income that Freelancers receive can vary depending on the payment method used by the Buyer, as does the price that the Buyer must pay. Therefore, we encourage Buyers to make payments using CB Balance to benefit both sides (Buyers and Freelancers).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following are the conditions for receiving payments that Freelancers get according to the payment scheme option that the Buyer chooses:

1. If the Buyer pays through VA, the Freelancer will be deducted as follows:

    a. Platform Fee of 10% of the total transaction.

2. If the Buyer pays through CC, the Freelancer will be deducted as follows:

    a. Admin Fee for PSP of 2.9% of total transactions + IDR 2,000;

    b. Transaction Tax Fee to PSP is 11% of the Admin Fee; and

3. Platform Fee 10% of the total transaction.

    a. If the Buyer pays through CC, the Freelancer will be deducted as follows:

1) Platform Fee 10% of the total transaction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The withdrawal fee is fully charged to the User with the following conditions.

1) Users can only make withdrawals via a VA that has been previously registered;

2) Users will be charged an Admin Fee for PSP of IDR 5,000;

3) Transaction Tax Fee for PSP is 11% of the Admin Fee; and

4) These fees will deduct the remaining CB Balance after withdrawal.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freelancers can withdraw their earnings using one of Collarbear's withdrawal methods (for withdrawal limitations, see the "Withdrawal Methods" section). To begin the withdrawal process for your available profits, click on the chosen withdrawal provider.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users must ensure that the information on the destination bank account matches the one required for withdrawing sums; if the User inputs the incorrect account number, the withdrawal application cannot be cancelled.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the destination account is not registered or is invalid, the deducted balance will be returned to the User’s CB Balance automatically.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the time being, CB Balance only recognizes IDR currency, thus Users can only withdraw their balance in IDR. Collarbear, on the other hand, does not rule out giving support for several different currencies, where market needs and wants, as well as input from our community, will be one of two determining considerations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collarbear may temporarily block the User's ability to withdraw balances to prevent fraudulent or illicit activity. This can happen if a security problem occurs, another User reports a proven violation or the system detects a violation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Withdrawals are irreversible and cannot be cancelled. We will not be able to stop this process once it has begun. If a balance withdrawal fails, the withdrawal charge will still be collected from the withdrawn balance.

### **Withdrawal Methods**

1. Local bank transfer

    a. BCA

    b. BNI

    c. BRI

    d. BSI

    e. Bank Mandiri

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Collarbear delivers funds to Users via the RTOL mechanism.

### **Withdrawal Amount**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The minimum balance that a User can withdraw in a single transaction is IDR 50,000.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The maximum balance that can be withdrawn: A user in one withdrawal is IDR 50,000,000,000 and a maximum of 5 (five) withdrawals per day. Withdrawing balances worth more than IDR 1,000,000,000 will incur an RTGS fee of IDR 25,000 per balance withdrawal transaction.

# **Order Disputes and Cancellations**

We encourage our Buyers and Freelancers to try and resolve conflicts that occur between them independently. However, if the conflict cannot be addressed, the User may submit a dispute through the Help Center and report it to our Committee.

### **General**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Order cancellations are permitted at Collarbear – if eligible – via the Order Details page per order and/or through Collarbear's Customer Support Service.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a violation of these Terms of Payment to submit transaction disputes and/or reverse payments through your payment provider or bank directly. Your account may be temporarily or permanently disabled if you do so. If you file a dispute with your payment provider or bank, the funds will be ineligible for return due to our commitments to the payment provider or relevant bank.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you encounter a problem with the services provided by our Freelancers, you are advised to use Collarbear's dispute resolution service to try to address the matter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collarbear, through PSP, reserves the right to cancel orders or withhold funds for alleged fraudulent transactions made within the platform.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All transfers of intellectual property to the Buyer must be paid in full (in advance) and the work will not be able to use if payment is cancelled for any reason.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Freelancer may revise work/deliverables based on what is stated in the PAW of the relevant Freelancer. Freelancers can decide how many revisions they want/can offer, including (if) no revisions (is also allowed).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the "Request Revision" button to request more services from Freelancers beyond the agreed-upon terms is not permitted.

### **Order Cancellation**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collarbear encourages Buyers and Freelancers to address disputes between themselves through the Help Center.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our Customer Support Services team will evaluate the feasibility of a request for Collarbear to cancel an order based on a number of reasons, including violations of our Terms of Service and/or Community Guidelines, common errors, and improper use of Collarbear's work/deliverables submission system.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically for Inside Worker service orders, the Buyer is permitted to dispute their orders could click the "Dispute Order" button on the Order Details page of the related order. Buyers can only submit a dispute if the Freelancer has sent (a) file(s) as an update for the project milestone at 50%. The Committee will decide how to distribute the money for the disputed order (either being returned to the Buyer or still being forwarded to the Freelancer).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Inside Worker takes longer in completing the work from the agreed processing time, the Buyer has the option to cancel the order and receive a 100% full refund.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifically for Field Worker service orders, if the Buyer cancels the order within less than 24 hours of the order processing time, the Buyer will receive a 100% full refund. Meanwhile, if the Buyer cancels the Field Worker service order within 24 hours of order processing time, the Buyer will not receive a refund. Instead, the funds will be distributed entirely to Field Workers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyers are not allowed to dispute projects with Field Workers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders cannot be cancelled based on the quality of the services/materials delivered by the Freelancer if the services are given as explained/described on the corresponding PAW page. You can rate your experience with Freelancer when you are asked to provide a review & rating, including the overall level of service quality received.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before contacting the Customer Support Service, you must first use the Collarbear Help Center to solve your problem and obtain the required resolution relating to the services provided/delivered by the relevant Freelancer. If the concerned person fails to notify the relevant Freelancer of the problem linked to the Freelancer's service, the Customer Support Service will not take any action on the order and will allow the Freelancer to provide independent solutions first. Actions like this are not something that is not allowed in Collarbear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any unlawful use of Collarbear discovered during the order process may result in order cancellation after being reviewed by our Customer Support Service team. This includes—but is not limited to; harassment, unlawful conduct, illegal behaviour, or any other violation of the Collarbear Terms of Service.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collarbear’s Customer Support Service will cancel orders for the following grounds, but not limited to:

1. Active orders (after the requirements/needs are submitted to the Freelancer and before the Freelancer delivers the work):

    a. The Freelancer is late and unresponsive for more than 24 hours while the order status is (already) marked as “Late”;

    b. Users are rude to other parties through threats (in the form of) giving low ratings or using ordered materials (such as logins, personal information) with each other;

    c. Users provide or include material that violates copyright/trademark as part of their requirements/needs or delivery of Freelancer’s work; and

    d. Users are no longer an active user of Collarbear due to violation of Terms of Service or deactivation of their account.
    
2. Orders sent (after Freelancer uploads the finale project deliverables file [Inside Worker] or doing a clock out [Field Worker] and before the order is marked as “Done”):

    a. The Freelancer utilizes the delivery system to extend the delivery due date in completing the requested service without providing the actual final delivery of the service. Note: Multiple reporting of proven violations will result in permanent suspension of your account.

    b. The freelancer does not submit files and/or proof of work related to the agreed-upon order requirements/needs. Note: Subjectivity (to) the material in question will be reviewed by our Customer Support Service team.

    c. Freelancers request additional payments both within and outside the Collarbear platform by withholding the final work/delivery of services directly relevant to the agreed terms/needs.

    d. Freelancers withhold final work/delivery of services in order to get a higher rating.

    e. Buyers who abuse the "Request Revision" button to get more services from Freelancers beyond the agreed terms

    f. Buyers who threaten to leave damaging reviews and/or bad ratings to get additional services from Freelancers that are not related to the agreed terms/needs.
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Buyer puts a Dispute Order while the project is in process or cancels the project due to completion delays, the following terms will apply:

1. A project without a project guarantee:

    1. If the ongoing project progress is 0-49%, then 100% of the money will be returned to the Buyer, and the order status will be "Cancelled"; and

    2. If the ongoing project progress is 50-99%, then 70% of the money will be returned to the Buyer, and the order status becomes "Cancelled".

2. A project with a project guarantee:

    1. If the ongoing project progress is 0-49%, then 10% of the deposit/project value/budget will be delivered to the Freelancer, while the remaining 90% will be returned to the Buyer; and

    2. If the ongoing project progress is 50-99%, then 40% of the deposit/project value/budget will be delivered to the Freelancer, while the remaining 60% will be returned to the Buyer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the order status is "Completed", the Buyer cannot dispute the order for any reason, so payments that have been forwarded to the Freelancer cannot be returned to the Buyer.

### **Chargeback**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collarbear reviews chargeback cases and payment provider disputes on behalf of Freelancer. While the outcome may vary case by case for each (different) chargeback reason, we strive hard to resolve disputes in the best interests of Freelancers. If the chargeback case allows, Collarbear (or one of Collarbear's PSPs) will reimburse some or all of the earnings to the Freelancer – otherwise – the chargeback sum will be borne by the Freelancer.

### **Refund**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collarbear does not automatically refund payments made for cancelled orders to your payment provider. Funds from order cancellations are returned in the form of CB Balance or Refund Balance and are available to be spent again at Collarbear.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The refund conditions vary based on the payment method, including:

1. Cancellation with CB Balance payment method:

    a. Funds will be returned to CB Balance; and

    b. The funds can be withdrawn using the withdrawal method provided by Collarbear.

Collarbear’s PSP will then return the relevant CC limit nominal to the User with a processing time of 7 to 14 business days;

    e. Funds in the Refund Balance can only be submitted for a refund per invoice, if some of the funds in an invoice have been used for a transaction, the remaining funds in the invoice cannot be refunded;

f. Refund requests cannot be made again for funds whose status has already been denied by the PSP for any reason; and

g. The invoice containing the Refund Balance is aged more than 4 (four) months old.
