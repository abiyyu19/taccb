const cgEN = '''Introduction

Collarbear is a platform that connects Freelancers with business owners or individuals (which can also be referred to as Buyers). Freelancers can freely offer and sell their services, while Buyers can post a requirement for a service or contact specific Freelancers via the platform's instant messaging feature, and then purchase the available services.
In their interactions, we always expect the best to happen between Freelancers and Buyers. Therefore, to maintain healthy interactions, mutual respect, safety and comfort for all Users, we make these Community Guidelines as a standard of norms and values that are expected for Users to behave on this platform.
As with the transformation of the digital world, which continues to improve and evolve, these Community Guidelines will also improve and change. The rules and restrictions outlined in these Community Guidelines are just a few examples of various phenomena that are deemed inconsistent or have the potential to harm platform users in general. These Community Guidelines are primarily concerned with forbidden services, prohibited content, prohibited behaviour, and policies on the use of minors as services or content from a service offered. We encourage all users of our platform to always report violations of these Community Guidelines using the reporting mechanism that we have provided.

Forbidden Services

Collarbear is a free marketplace for anyone who wishes to sell their abilities as a specific service that others can use. Buyers can also explore a variety of services. However, we explicitly prohibit any User from offering, requesting or purchasing a service that could potentially pose a danger of breaking the law, financial loss, piracy or hack/crack, violation of third-party service terms and conditions, or plagiarism or theft of work, health and security risks.
It is prohibited for each User to offer, request, and purchase:
Illegal services (such as prostitution, terrorism, corruption, and fraud), which have consequences and are deemed illegal acts;
Services aimed at providing assistance yet are considered illegal;
Services involving the falsification of official government documents or other documents that are protected by law and cannot be changed in any way except by the issuing agency/institution;
Services requesting access to specific data or information pertaining to specific personal information, finance or transactions, or medical records;
Loan services, money duplication and counterfeiting;
Data piracy or hacking/cracking of individuals, institutions, or products;
Fake and/or pirated account creation services;
Services for producing viruses, malware, trojan horses, worms, logic bombs, and other malicious material that is technologically harmful or has the ability to be harmful;
Manufacturing or genetic engineering services to produce viruses, bacteria, germs, or sources of certain infectious diseases;
Services for the fabrication of melee/sharp weapons, firearms, grenades, and explosives in prohibited quantities; and
Services for the production of illegal drugs.

Deceptive Services

Apart from legally prohibited services, Collarbear strongly advises all Users not to offer, request, or purchase certain services that are misleading and have a negative impact on certain people, institutions, or products in the context of political competition, commercial business, or hatred of certain groups.
It is prohibited for each User to offer, request, and purchase:
Services for posting negative reviews against persons, institutions, or items on any platforms;
Services for posting negative testimonials against persons, institutions, or items on any platforms;
Services for counterfeiting visitors, followers and buyers on any platform;
Services for developing Artificial Intelligence to mimic certain individuals' motions and speech;
Services that lead to the production of hate speech and prejudice against various races, ethnicities, and groups;
Services that cause psychological and mental disturbances to certain individuals such as bullying, sexual harassment, and the use of strong language contained in a product or service either explicitly or implicitly;
Services for making fake news (hoaxes); and
Services for negative political campaigning. Collarbear really appreciates political moments while still believing that every individual has the right to express their political choices. Collarbear, on the other hand, is vehemently opposed to any form of negative political expression aimed at rejecting, vilifying, or even insulting other individuals within the scope of political competition.

Other Services That May Contravene Academic Values or The Applicable Code of Ethics for Specific Professional Communities
Collarbear fervently opposes all kinds of offers or requests made by Freelancers or Buyers that have the potential to result in academic violations or to hurt or break the code of ethics of specific professional associations that are legally protected.
It is prohibited for each User to offer, request, and purchase:
Services for publishing scientific works for (on behalf of) others;
Testing services for schools, universities, and other educational institutions, as well as certain professional institutions that require an admission selection test;
Services for generating a doctor affidavit (for any justification) that are not in compliance with the code of ethics or applicable rules;
Services for generating expert recommendation letters (for any justification) that are not in compliance with the code of ethics or applicable rules;
Services for generating professional certificates (for any justification), which are not in accordance with applicable procedures and rules; and
Services for generating graduation certificates (for any justification), which are not in accordance with applicable procedures and rules.

Overpromising

We strongly recommend Freelancers not to make excessive promises when selling/offering their services, either through PAW, pitching, or during the Offer process. You don't know what unforeseen constraints can disrupt you, and it is feared that this action will backfire on you (e.g., Users who are your customers file a dispute on your project because they feel you are not delivering the appropriate work). Collarbear is not liable for the losses you suffer if your project is disputed and the Buyer wins the dispute.

User Generated Content (UGC)

Collarbear is also a platform for the User community (both Freelancers and Buyers) to contribute content. Collarbear believes and guarantees that all Users are free to utilize our platform to create interesting material as part of their freedom of expression and to voice their thoughts. Nevertheless, some content creation restrictions are deemed relevant enough to serve as guidelines.

Profile Information, PAW and Project Auction

Profile, PAW, and Project Auction are tools that allow each User to generate content that is tailored to their own needs. Each User can write, describe, and upload papers, photographs, animations, and videos to meet his or her needs (or content that is considered to reflect their request/offer).
It is prohibited for each User to offer, request, and purchase:
Using a false name (or the name of someone other than oneself);
Presenting forged (or unlawfully obtained) documents for verification;
Write a description on the profile, PAW or Project Auction using prohibited information, misleading, using offensive/foul language, has a proclivity for hate speech, discrimination, sexual harassment, bullying or other forms of violence that have not been defined either explicitly or implicitly;
Expressing prejudice against specific races, ethnicities, and groups through literature as well as through images, animations, and videos;
Upload documents, sounds, images, animations and videos that contain pornography explicitly;
Upload documents, sounds, images, animations and videos that contain explicit physical and mental violence;
Copying/plagiarizing other User's profile content, PAW and Project Auction;
Using documents, sounds, images, animations, videos or any files that are restricted for commercial use or do not have a license to use a digital asset, either as content or as a deliverable; and
Disrespect the services of certain Freelancers or mention certain Buyers explicitly.

Violent and Criminal Actions

Collarbear does not have full control over how each User acts, behaves, and interacts with other Users. This limitation must therefore be highlighted, as these Community Guidelines also have supervisory constraints, but strive to continue to urge all users to avoid behaviour that has a proclivity for all types of violence and criminality.
Each Collarbear User is prohibited from:
Provide threats both explicitly and implicitly, verbally and nonverbally;
Harassing or even threatening other Users;
Glorify violence, whether it has occurred or not;
Inciting other Users, whether or not they use the Collarbear site, to act illegally;
Harassing, bullying, disturbing, and even inflicting damage to other Users' mental and psychological health;
Explicitly reject engaging with specific races, ethnicities, and groups;
Steal other people's work for a portfolio or personal work; and
Explicitly expressing physical aggression against themself or others, whether it has occurred or not.
Children's Involvement in Content and Services
Collarbear has very explicit restrictions regarding platform age limits. However, various services demand the participation of minors, such as product photography, demonstrations, voiceovers, and other services that require minors as subjects or objects. Therefore, each Freelancer and Buyer must continue to adhere to the Terms of Service as well as the applicable local Child Protection Law.
Each Collarbear User is prohibited from:
Using minors to create content or provide services that lead to pornography and porn action (satisfaction/fulfilment of sexual desires); and
Using minors as labourers whose rights are violated, causes physical, mental, intellectual, and moral disturbances.

Decisive Actions

Collarbear will severely enforce these Community Guidelines against any User who violates them. Collarbear has the right to suspend or permanently terminate the infringer's account. Every User is expected to report any violations that occur using the reporting tools provided. Our Customer Support Service staff likewise needs sufficient proof to respond decisively. Collarbear will not process the action if there is insufficient (corroborating) evidence. Collarbear will always cooperate with authorities to take appropriate preventative and legal measures.
