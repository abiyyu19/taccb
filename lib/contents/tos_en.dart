By registering to create an account, you agree to provide us with accurate, up-to-date, and comprehensive information, and not knowingly register for distorted purposes. You are solely responsible for all actions you do while using CLICKJOB, including safeguarding the privacy and security of your personal information, account password, and any other sensitive data. We are not responsible for any negligence that you make with your own account.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Within CLICKJOB, Buyer can search, view Freelancer profiles, make contact with Freelancer via instant messaging media that has been provided within CLICKJOB, and place orders for services owned or offered by Freelancer through CLICKJOB.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Orders can only be made by the Buyer after the Freelancer sends a PAW Offer or custom Offer. If the Buyer does not make a payment within the specified time, the order will be canceled.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure User safety and convenience, when a Buyer places an order, the Buyer must make an advance payment to CLICKJOB (see CLICKJOB's Terms of Payment). If the Buyer has accepted the Freelancer's work, CLICKJOB will send the payment from the Buyer to the Freelancer. When ordering services from Field Workers, the outcome of the work is established based on a defined and agreed-upon time, and payment is then sent straight to the relevant Freelancer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each order must be completed by the Freelancer; thus, orders cannot be cancelled for any reason. The Buyer may cancel an order (after payment has been received), but only under certain circumstances. The Freelancer’s rating will be affected by the cancellation.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as otherwise agreed to by the Buyer and the Freelancer in the joint agreement, the Buyer has the right to ownership of the work delivered by the Freelancer when the Buyer makes a purchase. Future disputes over who owns the rights to the work, claims/ accusations of plagiarism, and/or contraventions of other government regulations/legal requirements that lead to legal action against Buyers or Freelancers are not CLICKJOB's responsibility.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All works submitted, published, or uploaded by Freelancer may be used without restriction by CLICKJOB for marketing and promotional strategies.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users are not permitted to use any other payment methods than those provided by CLICKJOB. Any orders or payments made outside of the platform or through methods other than those offered by CLICKJOB are not the responsibility of CLICKJOB.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Community Guidelines, which serve as the ground rules for the community and online trading on the CLICKJOB platform, must be followed by every User. These Terms of Service are inextricably linked with the Community Guidelines.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any account that violates the Terms of Service and/or Community Guidelines, or as a result of illegal activity or other actions that are not in accordance with the Terms of Service for use of services on the CLICKJOB platform, may have its account disabled temporarily (Suspended) or permanently by CLICKJOB. Users who have had their accounts temporarily suspended can get in touch with our Customer Support Service to ask concerns, gain clarification on violations, or learn the requirements for getting or reactivating their accounts.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each User must maintain the confidentiality of sensitive data and account passwords for the security of their account. In the event of an account breach and the original owner of the account seeks to freeze and restore their account, users must be able to verify ownership of their account at CLICKJOB’s Customer Support Service by providing materials or evidence that can prove authentication of account ownership.

# **Buyer**

### **General**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyer are not permitted to offer payment options other than those given by CLICKJOB.Buyers can only make purchases after getting an offer card from Freelancer.For the sake of mutual security and convenience, each User is prohibited from providing telephone numbers and other specific personal data to other Users. CLICKJOB disclaims all liability for the improper use of any data and information shared by a User with other Users.

### **Purchase**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Users are expected to read carefully the Terms of Payment in order to purchase and pay for services on the CLICKJOB platform.

### **Reviews & Ratings**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reviews on the Buyer's profile are a compilation of Freelancer reviews gleaned from all of the orders the Buyer has purchased.The rating displayed on the Buyer's profile is the accumulation and average of the overall rating gleaned from all orders that have been purchased by the Buyer.

# **Order**

### **General**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the User has successfully made a payment, the Buyer and the Freelancer will receive an order number in the form of a unique code. As soon as the payment is successful, the order status will be active and will show the "On Progress" status.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyer who orders Inside Worker services can receive deliverables in the "Draft" and/or "Finale" columns. By reviewing the deliverables after receiving them through the "Finale" column, the Buyer can decide whether to accept them or ask the Freelancer to make changes in accordance with the availability of existing revisions. Each file uploaded to the "Finale" column has a watermark that aims to protect the Freelancer's work before the order is actually completed by the Buyer. The order status will change to "Completed" if the Buyer decides to accept, at which point they will receive deliverables without a watermark. The payment will be sent to the Freelancer if they decide to accept.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyer can request (or receive) "Notes" or briefing notes, which are summaries of discussions that took place using the CLICKJOB instant messaging media. Briefing notes that Freelancer send can be accepted or rejected by Buyers. The briefing note form won't provide an option button if the briefing note is simply text-based. The Buyer may opt to accept or reject a change made by the Freelancer to the "Progress Line" or the percentage of work processes and/or a special offer made in the briefing note form. The briefing note will affect the payment plan in case of cancellation. Each User is urged to read and comprehend CLICKJOB's Terms of Payment in order to fully understand the requirements.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For Buyer who orders Field Worker services, the completion of work results is adjusted to the working time agreed on in the Offer. As long as the Freelancer does not do anything that can cause an order to be cancelled, then the completion of the service must be based on the amount of work time that has been mutually agreed upon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Freelancer may click the "Done" option to finish the job if the service work period has ended. After receiving notification that the job has been finished, the Buyer has the option of accepting the delivery or reporting the orders/delivery to our Committee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The order will be automatically completed if the Buyer does not respond to the completed order within the allotted time.

### **Order Handling & Cancellation**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Successfully placed orders mean that the Freelancer needs to get to work on his offerings. When the User signs in, the CLICKJOB system will send notifications via email as well as notifications on the platform.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyers are only eligible to cancel if:

1. The Field Worker is arrives late and/or absent; and/or

2. The Inside Worker is unable to finish the work by the due date (or as promised by the Freelancer in the offering contract).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to these justifications, to cancel an order, the Buyer must report the related order to our Committee through CLICKJOB’s Customer Support Service.

### **Project Auction**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLICKJOB provides a feature in the form of an auction system where Buyers can post requests for certain services with the aim of getting bids from Freelancers. Buyers can select the bid they believe is the best bid for them and begin the Offer with the Freelancer who wins the auction.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Buyer requires a service whose category is not/not yet available at CLICKJOB, then the Buyer can open a service project auction by selecting the closest category.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following conditions must be met for buyers to open auctions outside of their service category:

1. Does not contain ethnicity, religion, race, inter-group (SARA) and pornography & porn action;

2. Does not violate the Criminal Law; and

3. Does not violate Civil Law.

If a violation of one or all of these points is found, the system will suspend the offender's account for an indefinite duration/time. CLICKJOB is not liable for any losses incurred by the User as a result of the account suspension.

### **Project Guarantee**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A project guarantee offered by CLICKJOB is an option in the Project Auction. This option is subject to the Buyer's payment of a deposit equal to the budget's estimated outlay for the project that will be tendered.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This payment serves as a guarantee to the Freelancer of your commitment to the assignment. Your project's recommendations will be given precedence over those for other projects that do not use a project guarantee/without a guarantee deposit. When you want to make a transaction, you only need to pay the shortfall of the total project value that was agreed upon at the beginning—if there is additional project value requested by the winning Freelancer when the Offer occurs.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, if you do not select a bid from any Freelancer until the expiration date of your auction (24 hours before the expiration date), you will be given the option to extend the validity period (for free) or close your auction. If you decide to close the auction, the project's auction status will expire.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyers who employ project guarantees might select more than 1 (one) freelancer as the winner of their service project auction. The first winner of the auction will be the only one to receive the project guarantee; subsequent winners of the same service project for other Freelancers will not be eligible for a project guarantee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a provision for a minimum bid limit that is accepted for cancelling/deleting a Project Auction that does not forfeit 10% of the project guarantee value, that is, if the project budget is IDR 150,000 to IDR 10,000,000 it is limited to more than equal to 5 (five) bids, and IDR 10,000,000 and above is limited to more than equal to 20 (twenty) bids. Therefore, if the bid received exceeds the minimum limit in accordance with the specified project budget, the Buyer is required to choose at least 1 (one) winning Freelancer. For more details, please read the CLICKJOB’s Payment Terms & Conditions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The benefit Buyers will get when using project guarantees in the auctions they open (specifically for Inside Worker projects) is that Buyers will get 1 (one) extra revision for free which will be added to the number of revisions offered by Freelancers in the pitch of their bid.

### **Pitching**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freelancers can express interest and offer their talents by pitching at an auction for a service project that has been opened by a Buyer. The Freelancers taking part in the auction may not pressure or compel the Buyer to choose; rather, the Buyer has the right to freely select and decide which pitch will win.

## **Review & Rating**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We require Buyers to provide reviews & ratings after each successful order in order to preserve the credibility and caliber of our marketplace. Reviews & ratings are founded on transparency, honesty and are not dependent on any external pressure, ensuring the integrity of Freelancers inside the CLICKJOB ecosystem. Reviews & ratings cannot be given by Buyers if an order is cancelled/disputed.

# **Freelancer**

### **General**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At CLICKJOB, we never stop trying to keep everyone in our community safe. As a result, we strongly require Freelancers to authenticate their identities with official (directly issued) government identity credentials (i.e. ID card, passport).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some situations (if you offer certain categories of services), completion of this process is necessary in order to be able to advertise your services on CLICKJOB. Completion of this process can also earn you a "Verified" badge on your Freelancer profile.

### **Freelancer Type**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLICKJOB classifies Freelancers into two types, namely Inside Workers and Field Workers.

a. Inside Worker

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside Workers are Freelancers who (can) serve Buyers virtually (online).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is a selection of categories currently owned by Inside Worker:

1) Design & Graphics;

2) Web & Programming;

3) Photography & Videography;

4) Writing & Translation;

5) Digital Marketing;

6) Business;

7) Finance & Taxation;

8) Law; and

9) Self-Development.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Future market needs and expectations, as well as feedback from our community, will be one of the two elements influencing CLICKJOB's choice of whether to add new Inside Worker classifications.

b. Field Worker

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Field Workers are Freelancers who (must) serve Buyers face-to-face.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is a selection of categories currently owned by Field Worker:

1) Household;

2) Travelling;

3) Entertainer/Performer;

4) Beauty, Health & Sports; and

5) Automotive Service & Repair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Future market needs and expectations, as well as feedback from our community, will be one of the two elements influencing CLICKJOB's choice of whether to add new FIeld Worker classifications.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We reserve the right to make adjustments by adding, changing, replacing and/or removing certain types of services or service categories without prior notice. All types of material losses due to the adjustments to services and/or service categories including but not limited to digital purchases such as PAW promotion, the System will cancel the ongoing advertisements and Users will get a refund according to the value that has been used.

## **PAW**

### **Definition**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Professional Ability Widget (PAW) refers to the services that you advertise and offer at CLICKJOB. With PAW, Freelancers showcase their skills, expertise, qualifications, and portfolio to the world by displaying them at CLICKJOB like a shop window in a shopping centre where potential buyers can be lured into buying while looking around while walking and wandering aimlessly.

### **Revision**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revisions give Buyer the option to reject Freelancer's work and give the Freelancer more time to summarize Buyer's feedback and make any necessary alterations, based on the work submitted.Revision is a mandatory feature that Freelancers must include in their PAW to be provided to Buyers, with at least 1 (one) time revision. With revision(s), you must be ready to accommodate Buyer demands.Extra (paid) revisions can be submitted to the Freelancer if the free revision quota (which is included in the package offered by the relevant Freelancer to their PAW) has run out. When the Buyer sends a request for extra revisions, the Freelancer can decide to accept or reject it. If accepted, the Freelancer can set an additional price for the additional revision, and the Buyer must pay within the period determined by the Freelancer.When a request for additional revisions is submitted, AALT will pause and will resume running if the revision request is rejected or the Buyer does not pay within the specified time.

### **Lower Limit Price**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to maintain service quality and create an ecosystem with fair business competition in the CLICKJOB market, we set a minimum service price that can be offered by Freelancers (both Inside Workers and Field Workers) of IDR 150,000.

### **Auto Acceptance Lead Time (AALT)**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The price that Freelancers set for the services they provide/offer in each package in PAW is used by CLICKJOB to grade each package's AALT.

### **On Stage**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By utilizing a bid system, CLICKJOB offers Freelancers the opportunity to advertise their PAW on websites and mobile applications for a fee (or receive it for free) in accordance with applicable terms.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By using On Stage (also known as PAW Stage), Freelancers can increase their PAW traffic with PAW Stage. Thus, Freelancers can reach more potential Buyers according to the target, and then convert this traffic to generate sales.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freelancers must have a budget in the form of PAW Stage Balance as the sole accepted payment option to bid if they want to advance their PAW to the PAW Stage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To fill/top-up the PAW Stage Balance, you can only go through CLICKJOB Balance (or also known as CB Balance). PAW Stage Balance cannot be cashed out or transferred for any reason.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PAW that is elevated to the PAW Stage is not guaranteed by CLICKJOB to experience a boost in revenue.

### **Profile Rank**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Freelancers can increase their account status and reputation based on their activity and sales performance. Profile rank cannot be decreased. Every time a Freelancer completes an order, Buyer can provide ratings (in the form of stars) and testimonials for the Freelancer.The following are the CLICKJOB Freelancer profile ranking levels:

1) _Rookie;_

2) _Verified;_

3) _Professional;_

4) _Expert;_ dan

5) _Extraordinary._

### **Medal**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a reward system in place on CLICKJOB for various accomplishments made by Users, including both Freelancers and Buyers. Medals are decorative items that Users can proudly display on their profiles, and Freelancers can do the same in PAW.

### **Offer**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyers and Freelancers are only allowed to make Offer in the chat room provided by CLICKJOB. Any User who engages and communicates outside of CLICKJOB will not be covered by our Terms of Service.

### **PAW**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyers can show interest in PAW and/or Freelancers can offer their PAW. The user has the right to use the chat room as often and as long as possible to carry out conversations/negotiations until a mutual agreement has been reached.

### **Extra**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyers can request extra services from Freelancers and/or Freelancers can offer extra services to Buyers. Freelancers are allowed to charge additional fees to Buyers, according to the agreement obtained by both parties. If the Buyer does not make a payment, the Freelancer has the right not to perform the extra service.

### **Custom**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Buyers can request custom packages from Freelancers and/or Freelancers can offer custom packages to Buyers if the packages already in the PAW are not in accordance with the Buyer's needs. Freelancers are allowed to set a different price from the existing package to the Buyer, according to the agreement reached by both parties. If the Buyer does not make a payment, then the transaction will be terminated.

### **Project Milestone**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the Offer is made and an agreement is reached, Inside Workers are required to fill out the order form with project milestones. Project milestones aim to protect Buyers' rights to deliverables and Freelancers' rights to payment.

### **Notes & Extra Offers**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLICKJOB offers an optional notes function for Buyers who use Inside Worker services. Notes can be used to record anything deemed necessary by both the Buyer and the Freelancer in the form of Minutes of Meeting (MoM).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Buyer requires further work (not revisions), the Inside Worker can make an additional offer by completing the additional request form. According to the mutual agreement, the Inside Worker may charge the Buyer for additional shipping costs and time.

### **Physical Delivery Services**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLICKJOB allows Freelancers to deliver services in the form of physical objects to Buyers, but CLICKJOB does not provide a platform for both the process of sending goods and delivery courier services.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CLICKJOB takes no responsibility for the quality, quantity, security, and the form of physical products sent by the Freelancer to the Buyer.

### **Reviews & Ratings**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reviews on the Freelancer's profile are a compilation of Buyer reviews gleaned from all of the orders the Freelancer has completed.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The rating displayed on the Freelancer's profile is the accumulation and average of the overall rating gleaned from all orders that have been completed by the Freelancer.

# **Order Disputes and Cancellations**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We encourage our Buyers and Freelancers to try and resolve conflicts that occur between them independently. However, if the conflict cannot be addressed, the User may submit a dispute through the Help Center and report it to our Committee.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By asking for our assistance in resolving disputes (in other words, appointing CLICKJOB as arbitrator for CLICKJOB Users), each User agrees to exert efforts to resolve the problem including opening/submitting all information on User activities before, during and after making a transaction to other Users at CLICKJOB. User also agrees that settlement efforts will necessitate CLICKJOB to freeze orders in progress, and CLICKJOB reserves the ultimate right to decide solutions, including:

1) Reject the dispute and grant full rights to the Freelancer to continue the order; and

2) Accept the dispute and forward part or full of the payment to the Freelancer—in other words, return part or full of the payment to the Buyer.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Especially for projects with Inside Worker, Buyers who wish to dispute their orders could click the "Dispute Order" button on the Order Details page of the related order. Buyers can only submit a dispute if the Freelancer has sent (a) file(s) as an update for the project milestone at 50%. The Committee will assess and decide how to distribute the money for the disputed order (either being returned to the Buyer or still being forwarded to the Freelancer).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While disputes cannot be filed by the Buyer for projects with Field Workers (the "Dispute Order" button will not be present on the Order Details page of the related order).
